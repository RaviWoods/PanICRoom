    "FiveSixEight bar at Imperial College London launched a new app to assure the school that students going to the bar were ending up safely at home after attending the bar. The app tracks how many pints (or alcoholic drinks) each student has, and then asks the students in the morning whether they ended up safely in their own home. Students at Imperial are extremely honest, especially when they are hung over, so assume that all information from the app is valid.\n",
